### HOMEWORK:

[Read Through This Git Tutorial](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)

* [Email Me Your GitHub HW Repo Link](mailto:kaa328@nyu.edu)

* Make sure you have all software set up for next class. We won’t be using photoshop for a few weeks but please inquire about the student discounts.

* Make a new folder in your HW repo called Week_1. In that folder, save .txt or .md file with  your favorite cooking recipe. We will be using that to format some HTML next week. Use `git add` `git commit` and `git push` to upload these folders and files to Github, just like we did in class today.

*BONUS: Take a look at this [MarkDown cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). Use it to format your recipe with different text sizes and styles as well as bulleted and numbered lists. *Think Hierarchy*

**Documentation is 5% of your grade at IDM.**❊
