# HW Week 13

Keep working on your final projects. We will be taking a look at SASS and how we can create our own framework from scratch this Thursday. (Boostrap uses SASS)

[Install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) on your computers before Thursdays's class.
[Install SASS](http://sass-lang.com/install)

_Spoiler, we are going to take a look at SASS_

### Install SASS using command line:

```bash
gem install sass
```

If it does not install, and you receive an error you need to install as admin on your computer. `sudo` will always prompt you for your computers password:

```bash
sudo gem install sass
```

Check your version and confirm SASS is installed:

```bash
sass -v
```

## Presentations

NEXT week you will be presenting your final website projects. Your presentation should cover:

## Documentation

- Documentation of your process
- Explanation of some of your source code (not the entire site but sometime you found challenging or interesting you’d like to share)
- Any issues you encountered
- What you learned in order to accomplish your project
- Next steps – if you had more time and more tools, what would you do next?
- Your design and presentation is long part of your grade. I will be looking through your source code on github later this week.

## Source Code on Github

Be sure to have a visible folder labeled FINAL in your repository with your source code by FRIDAY May 5. Within your final folder, add a README.md file containing a link to the live hosted site if applicable, and a second link to your documentation.
