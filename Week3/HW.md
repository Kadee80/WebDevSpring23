# HW - Due Monday, Week 4

By now we should have gotten the hang of some simple git and GitHub terminal commands. By Monday of next week. Be sure to have posted folders with all HW assignments to this point to your HW repository. For example, HW assigned week1 should be posted to a Week_1/ folder in your repo. If you have not emailed me your repo link, now is the time to do that. I will be checking weekly from this point forward.

Start thinking about your midterm project. No stress here, I promise. Please think of a webpage you would like to make. This could be something goofy, a passion of yours or even the beginnning of a portfolio website. Wireframe the layout you would like to achieve. Bonus points for more detail. Remember think HTML and CSS and what you want to/need to learn. We will have several classes before this is due. We can learns some more fun stuff!

If you are still unfamiliar with git, practice! [Here is a helpful tutorial](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) that explains what git does and how to use it with github.
